# Introduction

## Objective

In this workshop, you will work on replicating the **Our World in Data** Page on the Self-reported life satisfaction data from the **Gallup World Poll**. Our World in Data creates gold-standard visualizations and data analysis. They provide a wealth of data on global trends and long-term changes.

The goal is to use R to replicate [this set of interactive tables and charts](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/happiness-cantril-ladder){target="_blank"} from Our World in Data on life satisfaction. We will use Quarto to generate a HMTL and publish it to GitHub pages.

You can find an example of the HTML page you will create for today's workshop [here](https://the-graph-courses.github.io/rmc_life_satisfaction_webpage/).

## Page Structure

Note that the example page is divided into **4 major tabs**:

1.  Table

2.  Map

3.  Chart

4.  Advanced (Optional)

For today's workshop, you will work on creating the **Table** and **Chart** tabs of the page!

# Getting Started

Each individual will work on their own website page. This means that although you might work in a breakout room with other students, you will each perform the following steps:

1.  Fork today's workshop repository to create a copy on your personal GitHub account: [https://github.com/the-graph-courses/rmc_life_satisfaction_webpage](https://github.com/the-graph-courses/rmc_life_satisfaction_webpage){target="_blank"}. This step should be completed in your web browser.
2.  Clone the workshop repository to your local computer using GitHub desktop.
3.  Open the project file (`rmc_03_workshop.Rproj`) in RStudio.
4.  Open and knit `week_03_instructions.Rmd` . The output HTML should now appear in your Viewer pane.
5.  In your Files pane, open the `index.qmd` file. This file contains the template for your assignment.
6.  Replace every instance of `"WRITE_YOUR_CODE_HERE"` with your answers.
7.  Refer to the instructions for guidance as you work through the assignment and fill out the **"Table"** and **"Simple Chart"** sections.

# Creating the webpage

## TASK 1: WRITE CODE TO CREATE TABLE

In the "ðŸ”¢ Table" section, you will create a table similar to the one on the Our World in Data page. The table should have the following columns:

-   Country

-   `2011`

-   `2023`

-   Absolute change
op./
-   Relative change

To accomplish this, you should:

1.  Filter the `cantril` data frame to just the years 2011 and 2023.

2.  Use the `pivot_wider()` function to create the columns for 2011 and 2023.

    **Hint:** You may need back-ticks around column names with spaces or which start with numbers.

3.  Use `select()` to drop any columns from the `cantril` data that are not needed in the table.

4.  Use the `mutate()` function to calculate the Absolute change and Relative change.

    **Note**: Within `mutate()`, you should round your numbers to 2 decimal places using the `round()` function.

5.  Then use `scales::percent()` to format the Relative change as a percentage.

6.  Use the `reactable()` function to create and output the table.

You can then skip the "ðŸŒŽ Map" section and go on to the next part.

## TASK 2: WRITE CODE TO CREATE CHART

In this "ðŸ“ˆ Simple Chart" section, create a simple line chart of the *"Cantril Ladder"* score over time for a few countries, similar to the one on the Our World in Data page.

*Note that your chart will not have the ability to filter countries like the one on the Our World in Data page.*

To accomplish this, you should:

1.  Filter the `cantril` data to just **4 to 8 countries** you want to highlight.

2.  Use `ggplot()` to create a **line chart** of the *"Cantril Ladder"* score over time, with different colors for each country

3.  Use `geom_line()` to create the lines

4.  Use `scale_y_continuous()` to set the y-axis limits to 0 and 10.

5.  Use `labs()` to create neat labels for the chart.

6.  Use `theme_minimal()` to set the theme.

7.  Finally, use `ggplotly()` to convert the ggplot chart to a `plotly` chart.

## TASK 3: ADD TABS

We want each section of webpage to be divided into 4 major tabs, as shown in the example webpage:

1.  Table

2.  Map

3.  Chart

4.  Advanced (Optional)

Use the `.{panel-tabset}` div in your qmd to produce these tabs. Refer to prework lesson on HTML documents and Quarto if you need help on this step. See this [video](https://thegraphcourses.org/courses/rmc-q2-2024/topics/html-documents-quarto/) around 8:30.

## TASK 4: RENDER YOUR `index.qmd` TO HTML

Render your qmd to a HTML webpage, and check to see that your tabs look correct!

## TASK 5: PUSH CHANGES TO GITHUB

Commit and push your newly rendered webpage to the remote repository.

## TASK 6: DEPLOY TO GITHUB PAGES

Change the settings of your repo to deploy the website to GitHub pages.

# Submission

-   Submit the link to the deployed website as a **text file (.txt)**.
-   **Make sure to test the link and double check that it works before submitting!**
-   The link will probably look something like this:\
    `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/NAME_OF_YOUR_REPO/`.
